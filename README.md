# Hello world

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile!
This repository is used to be the test repo (The "hello-world" guide), but I've decided to put some more informations about me.

About me
===========================
My name is Antoni A., I live in Aigle, Switzerland. Working as mechatronic engineer on light vehicles, editing files is, for now, learning about random things.
